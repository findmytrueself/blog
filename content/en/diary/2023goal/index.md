**Career Growth**

This is the first word that comes to mind.

As a developer, the most frightening thing is to be stagnant.

These days, I often feel that way, so I plan to revive my blog and write consistently.

I will revise the existing blog entries I wrote in Notion one by one and migrate them,
and I will refer to many new topics on Medium to make them my own.

I also need to avoid writing code like an amateur; I should think more deeply and aim to write it cleanly.

**Hobbies**

There are many things I want to do, but while struggling through life and thinking about realistic problems, I naturally ended up only sticking to light hobbies I can do at home.

Many active hobbies require a car and money.

When my friend Gevin visited, I tried snowboarding for the first time, and it was super fun. I plan to snowboard occasionally as a new hobby.

I can do it alone. I have a motorcycle, so I can go to a nearby ski resort (about 30 km away) to enjoy it! The problem is money.

**Piano**

I have a digital piano that I bought two years ago. I believe that everyone should be able to play at least one instrument, and I hope to play the piano well.

I learned piano without much thought when I was young, so I've forgotten all the theoretical aspects. Now, I memorize the entire score and practice until it becomes familiar to my hands.

That’s why it’s very hard to start learning, and the practice method is quite laborious.

I think perseverance is essential in everything. My goal is to practice steadily, little by little.

**Money**

By next year, I need to save over 100 each month just to get by. I have to endure.

Prices keep rising, so there’s a limit to how much money I can spend each month.

If I put in a bit more savings from here… I will really have nothing left.

I hope the situation with CodeXXXX and unfair contracts can improve, but unfortunately, ignorance leads to suffering in capitalism.

I hope the bull market returns so that my assets can at least increase a bit.

**Exercise**

I stopped going to the gym last year, and I wasted more than half a year... I feel so lethargic.

It’s a waste of money, and I worry about how to recover the muscle loss I've experienced.

There aren't many places around my house where I can exercise, so it won't be easy to keep going consistently.
