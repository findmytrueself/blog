I am a third-year front-end developer at my current company.

I believe I’ve done many important things here, but when it comes to confidently answering what I’ve accomplished, it feels awkward.

Recently, while using the updated ChatGPT 4o, I’ve noticed that I’m increasingly relying on it.

I always think that there is no such thing as 100% certainty in anything, but as the engine upgrades, it gets closer to providing correct answers.

Before using the paid version, I used to dismiss ChatGPT for giving silly responses, but now it’s truly different.

Is it really the same as the way I used to solve problems by constantly googling? I’m not sure. Is it okay to find answers through googling, but not through ChatGPT? That seems strange.

Anyway, I have many concerns about what kind of career I should pursue in the future.

The job market is getting tighter, and I’m personally feeling the difficulties of making a successful job transition.

I think I need to keep challenging myself. I have to keep studying and live with the mindset that tomorrow should be better than today.
