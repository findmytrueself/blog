English has always been important, but living in Korea, it's easy to forget its significance.

Recently, I attended Ethcon and realized how many people were proficient in English, which motivated me.

Simply telling myself, "I need to study English, I need to study English," doesn’t mean much unless I actually take action.

So now, I’m going to make it happen.

Like studying algorithms, improving English skills also requires consistent effort.

In fact, English is more crucial than Chinese in my work, so I have no choice but to study it.

I plan to return to the basics and practice by reading books on English grammar and speaking.

Step 1: Read Kim Seong-tae's English grammar book thoroughly.

Step 2: Practice speaking by reading and practicing with the 3rd stage of Speaking Matrix + utilizing ChatGPT.

Step 3: Take the OPIC exam.

If I prepare like this for about a year, wouldn’t I become proficient in English?

I always need to create an environment where I can grow.

In the end, I need to prepare for English to advance globally.

I’m thinking of creating an English section on my blog to document my progress.
