**flex-basis**

Similar to `width`, it allows you to specify the initial size of the box.

**flex-grow**

You can fill the available space in the overall box by giving it a value of 1. The default value is 0.

**flex-shrink**

It allows you to dynamically reduce the size of the box. The default value is 1.

**flex-wrap**

If the boxes exceed the screen width, they can be wrapped to the next line.
